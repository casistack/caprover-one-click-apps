-   Go to **apps** and click on **One-Click Apps/Databases**

## Build your own one-click app repository

You may want to build your own private repository. CapRover supports having multiple repositories. You can add new repository URLs to the one click app page. The official one, this one, is available as `https://oneclickapps.caprover.com`.

To create your own repository:

-   Fork this repository
-   Delete all existing apps (to avoid duplicate apps), and add your own apps.
-   Run `npm install -g pnpm` or `sudo npm install -g pnpm`
-   Run `pnpm i`
-   Run `pnpm run validate_apps`
-   Run `pnpm run build`

- RUN `npx prettier --write .`
-   Now you can host the static content placed in `./dist` directory anywhere you want, the official repo uses github pages to publish the content. Make sure to update [CNAME](https://github.com/casistack/caprover-one-click-apps/blob/master/public/CNAME) to your own URL if you decide to do so..
